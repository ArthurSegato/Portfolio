I've rewritten this entire game at least twice but haven't published it yet due to an ongoing struggle with Unity several UI systems.

LofiBlockRunner is an endless runner where a block has to avoid obstacles while lofi music plays in the background.

It was initially developed based on a Brackeys tutorial on youtube, and was submitted as an application for an internship at UVV's virtual reality lab. Although I didn't get the position, I continued to develop the game and later published it on Itch.io (v1.0.0), but regurlarly I come back to this project and redo everything from scratch to compare my evolution in game development.
