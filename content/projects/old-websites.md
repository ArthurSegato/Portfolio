I've created a diverse array of websites for various purposes, ranging from a graduation present portfolio for my sister to a virtual storefront for the Kafhia bikini store. Additionally, I've developed landing pages, created templates for sale on Fiverr - featuring an API integration to fetch data from Minecraft servers - and my own past personal websites.

As those projects are no longer in use, I have released their code under the MIT license on GitHub. They remain accessible solely for the purpose of showcasing my progression in web development.
