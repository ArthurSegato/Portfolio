# DislexiLess

>Looks familiar, uh?

DislexiLess is a solution composed of a web platform (Vue 3/Nest.js) and a mobile application (Flutter) that aims to facilitate the reading process for people with dyslexia and assist healthcare and education professionals in the treatment of individuals with dyslexia.

This tool was developed over a period of 4 months for my Computer Science thesis at Universidade Vila Velha. I was responsible for the development of the web platform, while [Eduardo](https://github.com/OmptOsu) was responsible for the mobile application.

The full thesis can be found [on the DislexiLess github repo](https://github.com/ArthurSegato/DislexiLess/blob/main/.github/assets/DISLEXILESS_TCC-2_ARTHUR_EDUARDO.pdf).
