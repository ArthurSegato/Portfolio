It has been in the public domain, under the CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, since 2022.", "I created theendpoem.com for two main reasons: first, to dissociate the end poem from Minecraft/Microsoft, and second, to protect the domain from potentially malicious actors. I foresaw that someone would exploit the popularity of the name in a negative way, as the website receives about 300 accesses daily", "At first, I developed the website using plain html, css, and vanilla javascript. However, after learning vue.js and nuxt.js, I rewrote everything in nuxt.js. Now, it`s deployed on the edge using Cloudflare Pages, just like this website here."]'}
