In high school, I began studying graphic design and video editing, even taking on a few freelance projects where I created visual identities, logos, and artwork for YouTube channels and social media pages. This experience provided me with a solid grasp of design principles like color psychology, typography, balance, and so on, which I've been applying to all my projects since then.

Below you can find some of my works that are still available in the wild...
