In high school, I began studying graphic design and video editing, even taking on a few freelance projects where I created visual identities, logos, and artwork for YouTube channels and social media pages. This experience provided me with a solid grasp of design principles like color psychology, typography, balance, and so on, which I`ve been applying to all my projects since then.

Below you can find some of my works that are still available in the wild...
